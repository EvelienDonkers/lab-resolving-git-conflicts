# Who am I

I'm Evelien from the Netherlands (No, I don't live in Amsterdam ;)). 
Currently I'm working as a junior consultant in finance and control. 
In my previous job I worked a growth marketeer so I have loads of experience in tooling, digital marketing an automatization.
I did a traineeship which covered A.I. and data analyses for a bit, besides that I worked a lot with statistics in university. 

# Why am I here

My new job is in the data analyses department of the company, to get this to the next level I decided to go to Ironhack. 
I expect to learn how to combine finance and control with data analyses. 

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

Work as a consultant in CIAD, my future role will be in the data analyses department. 
My future career goals is to become a partner of the company that I currently work in.
